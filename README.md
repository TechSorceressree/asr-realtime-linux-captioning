## Introduction

Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals often face limited accessibility to audio and video content on Linux due to the lack of native captioning support. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a real-time captioning system specifically for the Linux platform.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to bridge the accessibility gap for DHH users in the Linux environment. Existing solutions often lack real-time captioning or struggle with accuracy, background noise, and limited customization options. This project leverages OpenAI Whisper's automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to provide accurate, real-time captions and offers customization options for font size, color, and language settings.

## Problem Statement

- Limited availability of real-time captioning on Linux.
- Accuracy limitations of ASR models, especially with background noise and accents.
- Lack of customization options in existing solutions, hindering accessibility for DHH users with diverse needs.

## Solution Overview

The system utilizes OpenAI Whisper's ASR capabilities for accurate real-time captioning. A user-friendly front-end interface is built using Python libraries to provide customization options and enhance accessibility for DHH users.

## Key Features

- Real-time captioning via microphone input.
- High accuracy and offline functionality using OpenAI Whisper's ASR capabilities.
- Customization options for font size, color, and language settings.
- Seamless integration with the Linux platform for improved accessibility.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenAI Whisper
- Python libraries for GUI development

## Learning Outcomes

- Enhanced understanding of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology.
- Experience in developing user-friendly front-end interfaces.
- Problem-solving skills in addressing accessibility challenges for DHH users.
